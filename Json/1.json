    "question": "A patient with atrial fibrillation is started on warfarin therapy. After a week, the INR is found to be 1.3. What is the most appropriate next step?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Discontinue warfarin and start heparin",
      "B": "Increase the dose of warfarin and recheck INR in 2 days",
      "C": "Continue the same dose and recheck INR in 1 week",
      "D": "Switch to direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) immediately"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Warfarin has a delayed onset of action, and its effect is influenced by genetic factors, diet, and drug interactions. An INR of 1.3 is subtherapeutic, so increasing the dose and closely monitoring INR is appropriate. Immediate switching to DOACs (D) is not recommended without evaluating the patient's clinical status."

      "C": "Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV)",
      "D": "Single-layered micelles"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Multilamellar vesicles (MLV) consist of multiple lipid bilayers, allowing gradual release of the drug over an extended period, making them ideal for sustained drug delivery. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) (A) and large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) (C) have only one lipid bilayer, leading to faster drug release. Single-layered micelles (D) are not used for sustained release, as they dissolve quickly in biological fluids."

      "C": "β-Blockers",
      "D": "Digoxin"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "ACE inhibitors (e.g., enalapril, lisinopril) reduce afterload by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), leading to vasodilation and decreased vascular resistance. This improves cardiac output and is a cornerstone of heart failure therapy. Loop diuretics (A) primarily reduce preload, β-blockers (C) slow heart rate and reduce oxygen demand, while digoxin (D) improves contractility but does not significantly reduce afterload."

      "C": "Carvedilol",
      "D": "Spironolactone"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Digoxin enhances cardiac contractility and helps control heart rate in atrial fibrillation but does not reduce mortality. Instead, it reduces hospitalizations in heart failure patients. Sacubitril/valsartan (B), carvedilol (C), and spironolactone (D) all reduce mortality in heart failure."
