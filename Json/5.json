    "answer": "(A) Blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II",
    "explanation": "ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril and enalapril block the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), preventing the formation of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, thereby reducing blood pressure. Inhibiting sodium reabsorption (B) is the function of diuretics like furosemide and thiazides. Increasing heart rate (C) is an action of sympathomimetic drugs like epinephrine, while blocking alpha-1 receptors (D) is the mechanism of alpha-blockers like prazosin, which reduce blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels."

    },
    "answer": "(C) Esmolol",
    "explanation": "Esmolol is a ultra-short-acting β1-selective beta-blocker, making it ideal for acute arrhythmias, including supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, as it is quickly metabolized by esterases in red blood cells. Metoprolol (A) is a β1-selective beta-blocker, but it has a longer duration of action and is used for chronic hypertension and heart failure. Propranolol (B) is a non-selective beta-blocker used for migraine prophylaxis, essential tremor, and anxiety. Atenolol (D) is a β1-selective blocker with longer action, often used in hypertension."

    },
    "answer": "(C) Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade",
    "explanation": "Class II antiarrhythmic drugs, which include beta-blockers like metoprolol, propranolol, and esmolol, work by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors, reducing sympathetic stimulation of the heart, leading to decreased heart rate and contractility. Blockade of potassium channels (A) is the mechanism of Class III antiarrhythmics like amiodarone. Inhibition of sodium channels (B) is seen in Class I antiarrhythmics like lidocaine and flecainide. Calcium channel blockade (D) is the mechanism of Class IV antiarrhythmics like verapamil and diltiazem."

      "D": "Triglyceride clearance"
    },
    "answer": "(B) HMG-CoA activation",
    "explanation": "HMG-CoA activation does not lower lipids; instead, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) work by blocking HMG-CoA reductase, reducing cholesterol synthesis. PCSK9 inhibition (A) increases LDL receptor expression, promoting LDL clearance. LDL receptor upregulation (C) is a key mechanism of statins and PCSK9 inhibitors. Triglyceride clearance (D) is achieved through fibrates, which activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) to increase lipoprotein lipase activity."

    },
    "answer": "(C) Hydrolysis by β-lactamases",
    "explanation": "Cephalosporin resistance occurs mainly due to β-lactamase enzymes, which hydrolyze the β-lactam ring, rendering the drug ineffective. Ribosomal mutation (A) affects protein synthesis inhibitors like aminoglycosides and macrolides. Altered DNA gyrase (B) is the resistance mechanism for fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin). Efflux pumps (D) contribute to resistance against tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones."

      "A": "Acidic stomach pH",
      "B": "Alkaline intestine pH",
      "C": "Blood plasma pH (7.4)",
      "D": "None of the above"
    },
    "answer": "(A) Acidic stomach pH",
    "explanation": "A weak base is more ionized in an acidic environment because it accepts protons (H⁺) and becomes charged. The stomach (A) is acidic (pH 1-3), causing weak bases to ionize and become less lipophilic, reducing absorption. In the alkaline intestine (B), weak bases remain unionized and are more readily absorbed. Blood plasma (C) has a neutral pH, and weak bases are generally well-absorbed here."

    },
    "answer": "(B) The pH of the gastric environment",
    "explanation": "In floating drug delivery systems that rely on the swelling of hydrophilic polymers, the extent and rate of swelling are predominantly determined by the pH of the gastric fluid. Many swellable polymers (e.g., hydroxypropyl methylcellulose) exhibit pH-dependent hydration and expansion, which reduces the density of the dosage form, allowing it to float. Although effervescent agents (option A) are used in some floating systems, they primarily function by generating CO₂ to reduce the density rather than directly influencing the swelling mechanism. Options (C) and (D) are not relevant to the swelling behavior of these polymers."
