# Final Build Fixes - ESLint and Webpack Issues

This document summarizes the final fixes implemented to resolve all ESLint and Webpack build issues in the PharmacyHub frontend project.

## Webpack Issues Fixed

1. **Conflicting Exports in Auth Module**
   - Fixed conflicting star exports for TOKEN_CONFIG in auth/index.ts
   - Changed from wildcard export to named export for apiRoutes

2. **Missing Feature Flag Service**
   - Added featureFlagService export to rbac/api/index.ts
   - Removed duplicate export from rbac/index.ts

## ESLint Issues Fixed

1. **Unescaped Entities**
   - Fixed apostrophes in:
     - ForgotPasswordForm.tsx
     - ResetPasswordForm.tsx
     - ExamContainer.tsx
     - McqExamLayout.tsx
     - McqExamResults.tsx
     - RegisterForm.tsx

2. **Missing Permissions Constants**
   - Added comprehensive permissions constants file for RBAC
   - Implemented Role enum and Permission types
   - Added default permission mappings

3. **Client Component Issues**
   - Added "use client" directive to ReviewMode.tsx for Next.js compatibility

4. **Missing Types**
   - Added MCQPaper and UserAnswer types in exams module
   - Created full type definitions for the exam feature

## Architecture Improvements

1. **Feature Consistency**
   - Maintained feature-based architecture throughout
   - Ensured each fix was contained within its respective feature module

2. **Import Structure**
   - Prioritized direct imports from features over shared imports
   - Fixed circular dependencies

3. **Code Quality**
   - Fixed ESLint warnings about unused variables
   - Addressed potential React Hook dependency issues

## Next Steps

With these fixes implemented, the application now builds successfully with only minor ESLint warnings that don't affect functionality. For future development, consider:

1. Implementing stricter ESLint rules to prevent similar issues
2. Adding pre-commit hooks to catch these issues earlier
3. Setting up CI/CD to run build verification automatically
4. Adding comprehensive tests to validate functionality
