# PharmacyHub TypeScript Error Fixes

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the approach taken to fix the TypeScript errors in the PharmacyHub frontend project while respecting the feature-based architecture.

### Core Approach

1. **Direct Import Fixes:** 
   - Updated imports to point directly to the correct feature modules
   - Maintained the feature-based architecture and organization
   - No introduction of wrapper components or bridge files that would add maintenance overhead

2. **Feature Exports Enhancement:**
   - Added alternative exports in existing feature index files for backward compatibility
   - Used feature hooks with alias exports for legacy imports

3. **Type Consistency:**
   - Fixed type definitions across components
   - Replaced "icon" values with "default" for size props
   - Updated the input props where necessary

### Key Features Fixed

1. **Auth Feature:**
   - Added hooks exports with aliases for useSession
   - Fixed imports to point to the auth feature module

2. **RBAC Feature:**
   - Enhanced hooks exports with usePermissions alias
   - Updated component imports to use the RBAC feature

3. **UI Feature:**
   - Created necessary UI hooks for mobile responsiveness
   - Fixed import paths in components

### Type Definitions

1. **Auth Types:**
   - Created comprehensive auth type definitions
   - Defined roles, permissions, user profiles

2. **Shared Types:**
   - Implemented shared type definitions
   - Defined MenuItem interface for navigation

### Config Files

1. **Auth Config:**
   - Created auth configuration with routes and settings

2. **Menu Items:**
   - Implemented menu item configuration for navigation

## Testing and Verification

All error fixes have been tested for compatibility with the existing architecture. The changes:

1. Maintain the feature-based architecture
2. Do not introduce new directories or structural changes
3. Use existing feature modules for functionality
4. Fix type errors while maintaining backward compatibility

## Next Steps

1. Consider a more comprehensive refactoring to fully align with the feature-based architecture
2. Standardize imports across all components
3. Create a proper feature registry system
