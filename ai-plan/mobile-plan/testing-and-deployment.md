## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing and deployment strategy for the mobile compatibility implementation of the PharmacyHub Exams feature. A robust testing approach is crucial to ensure the mobile experience meets quality standards across various devices and network conditions.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Device Coverage Matrix

| Category | Device Types | Screen Sizes | OS Versions | Browsers |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **iOS** | iPhone SE, iPhone 12/13 Mini, iPhone 13/14, iPhone Pro Max | 4.7" - 6.7" | iOS 15, 16, 17 | Safari, Chrome |
| **Android** | Samsung S series, Google Pixel, Budget phones | 5.4" - 6.8" | Android 11, 12, 13 | Chrome, Samsung Internet |
| **Tablets** | iPad, iPad Pro, Samsung Tab | 8.3" - 12.9" | iPadOS 15+, Android 11+ | Safari, Chrome |

### 2. Testing Methodologies

#### A. Automated Testing

1. **Unit Tests for Mobile Components**
   - Test mobile-specific components in isolation
   - Mock device capabilities and screen sizes
   - Verify responsive behavior through snapshot tests

   ```tsx
   // Example unit test for a mobile component
   it('renders in compact mode on small screens', () => {
     // Mock small mobile screen
     mockUseMediaQuery.mockReturnValue(true);
     
     const { getByTestId } = render(<MobileQuestionNav questions={mockQuestions} />);
     
     expect(getByTestId('compact-nav')).toBeInTheDocument();
     expect(queryByTestId('expanded-nav')).not.toBeInTheDocument();
   });
   ```

2. **Visual Regression Testing**
   - Compare screenshots across different viewport sizes
   - Detect unintended layout changes during development
   - Use Percy, Chromatic, or similar tools

   ```js
   // Example visual regression test
   test('Question display renders correctly on mobile', async () => {
     await page.setViewport({ width: 375, height: 667 });
     await page.goto('/exam/123');
     
     // Take screenshot for comparison
     const screenshot = await page.screenshot();
     
     // Compare with baseline using visual testing tool
     expect(screenshot).toMatchImageSnapshot();
   });
   ```

3. **End-to-End Tests with Mobile Simulation**
   - Configure Playwright/Cypress for mobile viewports
   - Test complete exam-taking flow on simulated mobile
   - Verify touch interactions work as expected

   ```js
   // Example E2E test with mobile viewport
   test('User can complete exam on mobile', async ({ page }) => {
     // Set mobile viewport
     await page.setViewport({ width: 375, height: 667 });
     
     // Login and navigate to exam
     await page.goto('/login');
     await page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'test@example.com');
     await page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'password');
     await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
     
     // Start exam
     await page.goto('/exams');
     await page.click('a[href="/exam/123"]');
     await page.click('button:has-text("Start Exam")');
     
     // Answer questions using touch interactions
     await page.tap('[data-testid="option-1"]');
     await page.tap('[data-testid="next-button"]');
     
     // Complete and submit exam
     await page.tap('[data-testid="finish-button"]');
     await page.tap('[data-testid="submit-button"]');
     
     // Verify results page loads
     await expect(page.locator('h1:has-text("Exam Results")')).toBeVisible();
   });
   ```

4. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Run automated accessibility audits on mobile viewports
   - Check color contrast, touch target sizes, and keyboard navigation
   - Use axe-core or similar tools

   ```js
   // Example accessibility test
   test('Mobile exam interface meets accessibility standards', async ({ page }) => {
     await page.setViewport({ width: 375, height: 667 });
     await page.goto('/exam/123');
     
     // Run accessibility audit
     const accessibilityScanResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze();
     
     // Verify no violations
     expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]);
   });
   ```

       screenHeight: screenSize.height,
       orientation,
       deviceType: getDeviceType(),
       connectionType: navigator.connection?.type || 'unknown',
     };
     
     // Send to analytics system
     analytics.track(eventName, mobileProperties);
   }
   
   // Usage
   function handleAnswerQuestion(questionId, optionId) {
     // Regular tracking
     analytics.track('question_answered', { questionId, optionId });
     
     // Mobile-specific tracking
     trackMobileEvent('mobile_question_answered', { 
       questionId, 
       optionId,
       answerMethod: 'tap', // or 'swipe' if detected
