# Getting Started with the Exams Feature Preparation

This guide will help you kick off the preparation project for the Exams feature in PharmacyHub Frontend. It outlines the initial steps, development setup, and best practices to follow when beginning the implementation.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. Latest codebase checked out
2. Node.js and npm/yarn installed
3. Development environment configured
4. Access to the PharmacyHub repository
5. Understanding of the preparation plan and architecture principles
6. Access to the Confluence PHAR space for core module documentation

## Initial Setup

1. **Create a feature branch for the preparation**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/exams-preparation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies if needed**
   ```bash
   # Make sure all dependencies are installed
   npm install
   
   # For OpenAPI Generator (if not already installed)
   npm install --save-dev openapi-typescript-codegen
   ```

3. **Set up linting and formatting configuration**
   - Ensure ESLint and Prettier are properly configured
   - Review TypeScript settings for the project

## First Steps

Begin with Phase 1 of the plan, focusing on analysis and API evaluation:

1. **Document current directory structure and identify gaps (Task 01)**
   - This forms the foundation for all subsequent tasks
   - Create a comprehensive inventory of components, hooks, and utilities
   - Identify areas that don't align with architecture principles

2. **Evaluate and organize API integration (Task 02)**
   - Review the current API implementation
   - Check for consistent use of TanStack Query
   - Identify integration points with OpenAPI specifications

## Development Workflow

For each task in the preparation process:

1. **Create a subtask branch** from the feature branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/exams-preparation/task-XX-description
   ```

2. **Follow the implementation steps** for the specific task

3. **Commit regularly** with descriptive messages
   ```bash
   git commit -m "task(XX): Clear description of changes"
   ```

4. **Test thoroughly** after each significant change
   - Run unit tests
   - Test functionality manually
   - Ensure no regressions

5. **Create a pull request** for code review once the task is complete

6. **Merge back** to the main feature branch after approval

## Core Module Integration

When integrating with core modules:

1. **Review Confluence documentation** in the PHAR space
   - Study the documentation for each core module
   - Understand the interfaces and services provided
   - Note any version constraints or dependencies

2. **Use consistent patterns** for core module integration
   - Follow established patterns for API client usage
   - Integrate properly with the authentication system
   - Use the RBAC system consistently

3. **Consult with core team** when needed
   - Reach out to the core team with specific questions
   - Request information about API contracts or RBAC configurations
   - Coordinate on any needed changes to core modules

## OpenAPI Integration

When working with OpenAPI specifications:

1. **Obtain latest OpenAPI specifications**
   - Ask the core team for the latest specifications
   - Verify version compatibility

2. **Generate API clients and types**
   ```bash
   # Example command for generating OpenAPI clients
   npx openapi-typescript-codegen --input ./specs/exams-api.yaml --output ./src/core/api/generated
   ```

3. **Create adapters as needed**
   - Bridge between generated code and feature needs
   - Document adaptation patterns

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: Write/update unit tests for all refactored components
- **Integration tests**: Ensure components work together correctly
- **End-to-end tests**: For critical user journeys
- **Manual testing**: Verify functionality in the browser

## Progress Tracking

- Update the task status in the preparation plan as you progress
- Document any challenges or decisions made during implementation
- Regularly communicate progress with the team
- Raise any blockers or issues promptly

## Best Practices During Preparation

1. **One task at a time**: Focus on the specific task at hand
2. **Incremental approach**: Don't try to prepare everything at once
3. **Maintain backward compatibility**: Ensure the application still works
4. **Test continuously**: Don't wait until the end to test
5. **Document decisions**: Record why certain approaches were chosen
6. **Follow architecture principles**: Adhere to established guidelines

## Getting Help

If you encounter challenges during implementation:

1. Review the detailed task descriptions in the ai-plan/02 directory
2. Check the core module documentation in Confluence
3. Consult with the core team for specific questions
4. Refer to the architecture principles documentation

## Next Steps

After completing this guide, you should be ready to start implementing the preparation plan. Begin with Task 01 in the checklist and proceed sequentially through the tasks.

Good luck with the Exams feature preparation project!
