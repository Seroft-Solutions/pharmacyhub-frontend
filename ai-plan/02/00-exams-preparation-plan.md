# Exams Feature Architecture Preparation Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for preparing the Exams feature in PharmacyHub Frontend to align with the Feature-First Organization principle and Core Layer Foundation approach.

## Current Structure Analysis

The current Exams feature has a partially structured organization with several subdirectories:

- `api`: API integration with TanStack Query
- `components`: UI components organized by function
- `constants`: Feature constants
- `hooks`: Custom React hooks
- `model`: Deprecated model types
- `lib`: Utility libraries
- `progress`: Progress tracking functionality
- `rbac`: Role-based access control integration
- `store`: Zustand state management
- `styles`: Feature-specific styles
- `types`: TypeScript type definitions
- `utils`: Utility functions

The app directory structure is also in need of significant reorganization, with inconsistent route group usage, duplicated functionality, and unclear organization.

## Target Structure

We'll be refactoring to match the specified architecture with a feature-first approach:

```
/src
  /features
    /exams                  # Exams feature module
      /components           # Feature-specific components
        /atoms              # Smallest components
        /molecules          # Combinations of atoms
        /organisms          # Larger components composed of molecules
        /templates          # Page layouts specific to this feature
      /hooks                # Feature-specific hooks
      /api                  # Feature-specific API calls
      /types                # Feature-specific types
      /state                # Feature-specific Zustand stores
      /utils                # Feature-specific utilities
      index.ts             # Public API of this feature
```

We'll also implement a modern Next.js 15 routing structure with properly organized route groups and dynamic routes:

```
/src/app
  ├── layout.tsx            # Root layout with providers
  ├── page.tsx              # Landing page
  ├── (auth)                # Auth route group (doesn't affect URL)
  │   ├── layout.tsx        # Auth layout with redirects
  │   ├── login             # /login
  │   ├── register          # /register
  │   └── ...               # Other auth routes
  ├── (dashboard)           # Dashboard route group
  │   ├── layout.tsx        # Dashboard layout with user nav
  │   ├── page.tsx          # /dashboard
  │   └── ...               # Other dashboard routes
  ├── (exams)               # Exams route group
  │   ├── layout.tsx        # Exams layout with exams navigation
  │   ├── page.tsx          # /exams
  │   ├── [examId]          # /exams/[examId]
  │   ├── dashboard         # /exams/dashboard
  │   └── payments          # /exams/payments
  └── (admin)               # Admin route group
      ├── layout.tsx        # Admin layout with admin checks
      ├── page.tsx          # /admin
      └── ...               # Admin routes
```

## Preparation Process Overview

1. Analyze and document the current Exams feature structure
2. Identify components to be refactored according to architecture principles
3. Organize components following atomic design principles
4. Review and improve state management implementation
5. Ensure proper integration with core modules
6. Implement comprehensive authentication and authorization system
7. Reorganize app directory with proper route groups
8. Implement Next.js 15 routing with slugs for dynamic routes
9. Integrate payment system for premium exams
10. Validate API contracts with OpenAPI specifications
11. Clean up deprecated code and finalize preparation
