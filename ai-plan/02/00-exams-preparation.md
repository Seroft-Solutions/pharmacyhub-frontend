# Exams Feature Refactoring Plan: "exams-preparation"

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for refactoring the exams feature of PharmacyHub Frontend to align with the Feature-First Organization principle and Core Layer Foundation approach.

## Current Structure Analysis

The current exams feature has the following structure:

```
/src/features/exams
  /api
  /components
    /admin
    /common
    /guards
    /layout
    /mcq
    /premium
    /quiz
    /results
    /review
    /shared
    /sidebar
    /student
  /constants
  /hooks
  /lib
  /model
  /progress
  /rbac
  /store
  /styles
  /types
  /utils
```

While this structure has some organization, it doesn't fully align with the feature-based architecture principles. The current implementation has large, monolithic components, inconsistent state management, and doesn't follow the atomic design principles consistently.

## Target Structure

We'll be refactoring to match the specified architecture with domain-based organization:

```
/src/features/exams
  /api                      # API integration layer
    /adapters               # API response transformers
    /hooks                  # API-specific hooks
    /services               # API service functions 
    /types                  # API-specific types
    index.ts               # Public API
    
  /core                     # Core exam functionality
    /components             # Core components
    /hooks                  # Core hooks
    /state                  # Core Zustand store
    /types                  # Core types
    /utils                  # Core utilities
    index.ts               # Public API
    
  /taking                   # Exam taking feature
    /components
      /atoms                # Smallest components
      /molecules            # Combinations of atoms
      /organisms            # Larger components
      /templates            # Page layouts
    /hooks                  # Feature-specific hooks
    /state                  # Feature-specific Zustand store
    /types                  # Feature-specific types
    /utils                  # Feature-specific utilities
    index.ts               # Public API
    
  /creation                 # Exam creation feature
    /components             # (Same structure as taking)
    /hooks
    /state
    /types
    /utils
    index.ts
    
  /review                   # Exam review feature
    /components             # (Same structure as taking)
    /hooks
    /state
    /types
    /utils
    index.ts
    
  /management               # Exam management (admin)
    /components             # (Same structure as taking)
    /hooks
    /state
    /types
    /utils
    index.ts
    
  /analytics                # Exam analytics/statistics
    /components             # (Same structure as taking)
    /hooks
    /state
    /types
    /utils
    index.ts
    
  /rbac                     # Role-based access control
    /guards                 # Access control components
    /hooks                  # Permission hooks
    /types                  # Permission types
    index.ts               # Public API
    
  /premium                  # Premium features
    /components
    /hooks
    /state
    index.ts
    
  /deprecated               # Legacy code (temporary)
    README.md              # Migration information
    
  index.ts                  # Public API for the entire feature
```

## Refactoring Process Overview

1. Create the new exams feature structure
2. Define domain-specific types and interfaces
3. Set up Zustand stores for each domain
4. Create centralized API integration layer
5. Refactor large components into smaller, domain-specific components
6. Implement proper RBAC integration
7. Add OpenAPI integration for API type safety
8. Apply code quality standards
9. Write tests for new components and stores
10. Clean up and finalize

## Integration with Core Module

The refactored exams feature will integrate with the core module as follows:

1. Authentication: Use core/auth for user authentication
2. RBAC: Use core/rbac for role-based access control
3. API Integration: Use core/api for API request handling
4. UI Components: Use core/ui for shared UI components
5. Utilities: Use core/utils for shared utilities

## Conclusion

This refactoring plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for transforming the exams feature to align with the application's architecture principles. By following this plan, we'll create a more maintainable, scalable, and feature-focused implementation.
