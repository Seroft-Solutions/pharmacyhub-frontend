# Exams Feature Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for refactoring the Exams feature of PharmacyHub Frontend to fully align with the Feature-First Organization principle and Core Layer Foundation approach.

## Current Structure Analysis

The current Exams feature structure follows these directories:

- `api`: API integration using TanStack Query
- `components`: UI components organized by functionality
- `constants`: Feature-specific constants
- `hooks`: Custom React hooks
- `lib`: Utility libraries specific to exams
- `model/deprecated`: Deprecated model types (to be replaced with types)
- `navigation`: Navigation-related code
- `progress`: Progress tracking functionality
- `rbac`: Role-based access control for exams
- `store`: Zustand stores for exam state management
- `styles`: CSS styles (should be co-located with components)
- `types`: TypeScript type definitions
- `utils`: Utility functions

While this structure is closer to the target architecture than some other features, it still requires refactoring to fully adhere to the established principles.

## Target Structure

```
/features
  /exams                           # Exams business capability
    /components                    # Exam-specific components
      /atoms                       # Basic UI elements
      /molecules                   # Combinations of atoms
      /organisms                   # Larger components
      /templates                   # Page layouts for exams
    /hooks                         # Exam-specific hooks
    /api                           # Exam-specific API calls
      /constants                   # API endpoint constants
      /hooks                       # React Query hooks
      /services                    # API services
      /index.ts                    # Public API
    /types                         # Exam-specific types
    /state                         # Exam-specific state
      /stores                      # Zustand stores
      /context                     # React Context
      /index.ts                    # Public state API
    /utils                         # Exam-specific utilities
    /rbac                          # Exam-specific RBAC
    /index.ts                      # Public API of the exams feature
```

## Refactoring Process Overview

1. Restructure the directory to match the target architecture
2. Refactor components to follow atomic design principles
3. Migrate deprecated models to proper types structure
4. Ensure all components adhere to size and responsibility limitations
5. Consolidate styles with their respective components
6. Ensure proper state management with Zustand and TanStack Query
7. Create clear public APIs through index.ts files
8. Update RBAC implementation to fully leverage core RBAC module
