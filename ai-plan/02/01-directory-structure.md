# Task 01: Document Current Directory Structure and Identify Gaps

## Description
Analyze the current Exams feature directory structure, document its organization, and identify gaps or inconsistencies with the desired architecture principles. This will provide a clear understanding of what needs to be changed in subsequent tasks.

## Current Structure
```

```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Document existing component organization**
   - Catalog all components in the feature
   - Note their current organization and responsibilities
   - Identify components that don't follow single responsibility principle
   - Flag components exceeding size limitations (>200 lines)

2. **Analyze current API integration**
   - Document the current TanStack Query implementation
   - Identify any API calls not using TanStack Query
   - Verify alignment with OpenAPI specifications

3. **Review state management**
   - Document all Zustand stores and their purposes
   - Identify any state management not using Zustand
   - Check for appropriate use of React Context

4. **Identify atomic design gaps**
   - Determine which components should be atoms, molecules, organisms, or templates
   - Check if components are organized according to atomic design principles
   - List components that need reorganization

5. **Verify core module integration**
   - Check if the feature properly uses core services
   - Identify any feature-specific implementations of core functionality
   - Document dependencies on core modules

6. **Check for deprecated code**
   - Identify deprecated code that should be removed
   - Document replacement implementations

7. **Create a gap analysis report**
   - Summarize findings
   - Prioritize issues to address
   - Reference specific files and components needing attention

## Verification Criteria
- Complete inventory of all components, hooks, and utilities
- Identification of all components not meeting architecture principles
- Clear documentation of state management approach
- Comprehensive gap analysis report

## Time Estimate
Approximately 4-6 hours

## Dependencies
None - This is the first task in the preparation process

## Risks
- May uncover more issues than anticipated, requiring adjustment to the plan
- Some components may have complex dependencies making reorganization challenging
