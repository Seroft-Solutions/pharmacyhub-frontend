# Task 15: Final Verification

## Description
Perform comprehensive verification of the Exams feature to ensure that all preparation tasks have been successfully completed, the feature adheres to architecture principles, and everything functions correctly. This task serves as the final checkpoint before considering the preparation complete.

## Current State Analysis
All previous tasks should be completed before starting this verification task. The feature should now be properly organized, documented, and aligned with the core architecture principles.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Review task completion**
   - Verify that all previous tasks have been completed
   - Check that all deliverables for each task are present
   - Validate that all issues identified in previous tasks have been addressed
   - Document any remaining issues or concerns

2. **Verify directory structure**
   - Confirm the directory structure follows architecture principles
   - Check that components are organized according to atomic design
   - Verify that feature-specific modules are properly separated
   - Ensure no deprecated structure remains

3. **Validate component implementation**
   - Verify component size limitations (max 200 lines)
   - Check for adherence to single responsibility principle
   - Validate proper prop interfaces and TypeScript typing
   - Ensure consistent patterns across components

4. **Check state management**
   - Verify Zustand implementation for feature state
   - Validate TanStack Query for server state
   - Check React Context usage for simple state
   - Confirm proper state access patterns in components

5. **Test API integration**
   - Verify all API calls use TanStack Query
   - Check for proper error handling
   - Validate integration with OpenAPI specifications
   - Test API functionality with different scenarios

6. **Verify RBAC implementation**
   - Check for consistent use of new RBAC system
   - Test feature access with different roles
   - Validate operation-specific permissions
   - Ensure no legacy permission system remains

7. **Perform cross-cutting verification**
   - Check for proper core module integration
   - Verify import paths and structure
   - Validate documentation accuracy
   - Check for any remaining deprecated code
