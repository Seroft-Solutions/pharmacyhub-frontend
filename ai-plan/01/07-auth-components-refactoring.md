# Task 07: Refactor core/auth Components

## Description
Refactor the authentication components that have been migrated to the core/auth directory to ensure they follow the component design principles and leverage Zustand for state management.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Component Analysis**
   - Review all migrated components in core/auth
   - Identify components that exceed the 200-line limit
   - Identify components with mixed responsibilities
   - Identify components with state management issues

2. **Component Decomposition**
   - Apply functional decomposition to split larger components
   - Apply UI pattern decomposition for any UI components
   - Apply container/presentation separation
   - Extract forms, modals, and other complex UI elements into separate components

3. **Zustand Implementation**
   - Design a Zustand store for authentication state
   - Implement actions for login, logout, session management
   - Add selectors for auth state access
   - Ensure proper persistence if required

4. **Authentication Flow Improvement**
   - Refactor login/logout flows
   - Implement proper token management
   - Implement refresh token logic if used
   - Ensure secure storage of auth tokens

5. **Authentication Hook Standardization**
   - Create and standardize hooks for auth operations
   - Implement useUser, useLogin, useLogout, etc.
   - Ensure proper error handling
   - Add loading states

6. **Documentation**
   - Document all auth hooks and components
   - Document authentication flow
   - Document state management approach
   - Update the README.md with usage examples

## Verification Criteria
- All auth components follow the single responsibility principle
- No component exceeds 200 lines
- All functions stay within 20-30 line limit
- Zustand used for auth state management
- Clear separation of UI and logic
- Proper hooks for auth operations
- Clear documentation

## Time Estimate
Approximately 2-3 days

## Dependencies
- Task 03: Migrate app-auth to core/auth

## Risks
- May break existing authentication flows if not carefully refactored
- Session management changes may affect user experience
- Security implications if token handling is changed
