# Getting Started with the PharmacyHub Refactoring Project

This guide will help you kick off the refactoring project for PharmacyHub Frontend. It outlines the initial steps, development setup, and best practices to follow when beginning the implementation.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. Latest codebase checked out
2. Node.js and npm/yarn installed
3. Development environment configured
4. Access to repository and related systems
5. Understanding of the refactoring plan and architecture principles

## Initial Setup

1. **Create a feature branch for the refactoring**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/core-architecture-refactor
   ```

2. **Install any additional dependencies needed**
   ```bash
   # For Zustand state management
   npm install zustand
   
   # For TanStack Query
   npm install @tanstack/react-query
   
   # For OpenAPI Generator
   npm install --save-dev openapi-typescript-codegen
   ```

3. **Set up linting and formatting configuration**
   - Ensure ESLint and Prettier are properly configured
   - Consider stricter TypeScript settings for better type safety

## First Steps

Begin with Phase 1 of the checklist, focusing on the directory structure and initial migration:

1. **Create the new core directory structure**
   - This forms the foundation for all subsequent tasks
   - Follow the structure outlined in Task 01

2. **Start with migrating the app-api-handler**
   - This is a foundational piece that other modules will depend on
   - Follow the migration steps in Task 02

## Development Workflow

For each task in the refactoring process:

1. **Create a subtask branch** from the feature branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/core-architecture-refactor/task-XX-description
   ```

2. **Follow the checklist items** for the specific task

3. **Commit regularly** with descriptive messages
   ```bash
   git commit -m "task(XX): Clear description of changes"
   ```

4. **Test thoroughly** after each significant change
   - Run unit tests
   - Test functionality manually
   - Ensure no regressions

5. **Create a pull request** for code review once the task is complete

6. **Merge back** to the main feature branch after approval

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: Write/update unit tests for all refactored components
- **Integration tests**: Ensure components work together correctly
- **End-to-end tests**: For critical user journeys
- **Manual testing**: Verify functionality in the browser

## Communication and Progress Tracking

- Update the refactoring-checklist.md as tasks are completed
- Document any challenges or decisions made during implementation
- Regularly communicate progress with the team
- Raise any blockers or issues promptly

## Best Practices During Refactoring

1. **One change at a time**: Focus on the specific task at hand
2. **Incremental approach**: Don't try to refactor everything at once
3. **Maintain backward compatibility**: Ensure the application still works
4. **Test continuously**: Don't wait until the end to test
5. **Document decisions**: Record why certain approaches were chosen
6. **Keep the team informed**: Share progress and learnings

## Getting Help

If you encounter challenges during implementation:

1. Review the detailed task descriptions in the ai-plan/01 directory
2. Check the example code provided
3. Consult the reference architecture principles
4. Reach out to the team for assistance

## Next Steps

After completing this guide, you should be ready to start implementing the refactoring plan. Begin with Task 01 in the checklist and proceed sequentially through the tasks.

Good luck with the refactoring project!
