## Daily Progress Log

### Week 1

#### Day 1 (03/29/2025)
- Tasks completed:
  - Created JIRA task PHAR-234 for tracking the refactoring
  - Created new core directory structure (Task 01)
  - Added placeholder index.ts files for all modules
  - Created README.md for core module documentation
  - Migrated app-api-handler to core/api (Task 02)
  - Migrated app-auth to core/auth (Task 03)
  - Created marker for deprecated code
- Issues encountered:
  - Some integration points between auth and API need to be revisited once both modules are fully migrated
- Next steps:
  - Proceed with Task 04: Migrating app-rbac to core/rbac

## Testing Status

| Component | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | E2E Tests | Test Coverage |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|-----------|---------------|
| core/api | Not Started | Not Started | Not Started | 0% |
| core/auth | Not Started | Not Started | Not Started | 0% |
| core/rbac | Not Started | Not Started | Not Started | 0% |
| core/ui | Not Started | Not Started | Not Started | 0% |

## Notes and Decisions

- Decision 1: [03/29/2025] - Created directory structure following the architecture principles
- Decision 2: [03/29/2025] - Used placeholder index.ts files for all modules to establish the pattern for proper public APIs
- Decision 3: [03/29/2025] - Migrated app-api-handler and marked it as deprecated instead of deleting immediately to maintain compatibility during the transition
- Decision 4: [03/29/2025] - Migrated app-auth with minimal changes to ensure backward compatibility while moving towards the new architecture
