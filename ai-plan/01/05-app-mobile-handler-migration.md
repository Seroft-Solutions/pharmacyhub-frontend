# Task 05: Migrate app-mobile-handler

## Description
Evaluate and migrate the app-mobile-handler module, determining whether it belongs in the core layer or should be refactored as a separate feature.

## Current Structure Analysis
The current app-mobile-handler contains:
- components
- store
- utils
- index.ts

This module appears to handle mobile-specific functionality, which may or may not be a cross-cutting concern.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Assessment Phase**
   - Review the functionality of app-mobile-handler
   - Determine if this is truly a core cross-cutting concern
   - If it's a cross-cutting concern, plan migration to `/core/mobile`
   - If it's a feature, plan migration to `/features/mobile`

2. **Decision Making**
   - Criteria for core placement:
     - Is it used by multiple features?
     - Is it handling platform concerns rather than business logic?
     - Is it providing infrastructure rather than business capabilities?
   - If yes to these, migrate to core, otherwise to features

3. **Migration Phase (if core)**
   - Create `/core/mobile` directory structure
   - Move mobile components to `/core/mobile/components`
   - Move mobile state (store) to `/core/mobile/state`
   - Convert to Zustand if not already
   - Move utilities to `/core/mobile/utils`

4. **Migration Phase (if feature)**
   - Create `/features/mobile` directory structure
   - Move mobile components to `/features/mobile/components`
   - Organize according to atomic design principles
   - Move mobile state to `/features/mobile/state`
   - Move utilities to `/features/mobile/utils`

5. **Refactoring Phase**
   - Split components that exceed 200 lines
   - Ensure each function follows the 20-30 line limit
   - Apply appropriate state management
   - Update imports throughout the codebase

6. **Public API Phase**
   - Define a clear public API in index.ts
   - Create README.md documenting the functionality

## Verification Criteria
- Mobile handler functionality properly migrated
- No component exceeds 200 lines
- All functions stay within 20-30 line limit
- Clear separation of concerns
- Proper state management implementation
- Clear and documented public API

## Time Estimate
Approximately 1 day

## Dependencies
- Task 01: Create new core directory structure

## Risks
- May require changes to how mobile detection/adaptation is handled
- May impact multiple features if mobile functionality is widely used
