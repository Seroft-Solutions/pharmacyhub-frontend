# Task 08: Refactor core/rbac Components

## Description
Refactor the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) components that have been migrated to the core/rbac directory to ensure they follow the component design principles and leverage appropriate state management.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Component Analysis**
   - Review all migrated components in core/rbac
   - Identify components that exceed the 200-line limit
   - Identify components with mixed responsibilities
   - Identify components with state management issues

2. **Component Decomposition**
   - Apply functional decomposition to split larger components
   - Split permission checking logic from UI components
   - Apply container/presentation separation
   - Extract complex logic into utility functions

3. **State Management Implementation**
   - Evaluate current state management approach
   - Implement Zustand store for complex RBAC state if needed
   - Maintain React Context for simpler state if appropriate
   - Create selectors for permissions checking
   - Ensure proper integration with authentication state

4. **Permission System Standardization**
   - Refactor permission checking mechanisms
   - Create standardized hooks for permission checks
   - Implement higher-order components or render props for permission-based rendering
   - Ensure scalable permission definition system

5. **RBAC Component Optimization**
   - Optimize permission checking performance
   - Implement memoization for permission checks
   - Reduce unnecessary re-renders
   - Ensure RBAC components are lightweight

6. **Documentation**
   - Document all RBAC hooks and components
   - Document permission system
   - Document state management approach
   - Update the README.md with usage examples
   - Create examples for common RBAC scenarios

## Verification Criteria
- All RBAC components follow the single responsibility principle
- No component exceeds 200 lines
- All functions stay within 20-30 line limit
- Appropriate state management used
- Clear separation of UI and logic
- Proper hooks for permission checks
- Good performance for permission checking
- Clear documentation and examples

## Time Estimate
Approximately 2 days

## Dependencies
- Task 04: Migrate app-rbac to core/rbac

## Risks
- May break existing permission checks if not carefully refactored
- Performance implications if permission checking is not optimized
- Security implications if permission system is changed
