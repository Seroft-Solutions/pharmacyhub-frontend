# Task 16: Update Documentation

## Description
Update documentation across the codebase to reflect the new architecture, component structure, and best practices, ensuring that developers have proper guidance for maintaining and extending the application.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Core Module Documentation**
   - Create or update README.md for each core module
   - Document the public API of each module
   - Document the internal structure
   - Provide usage examples

2. **Component Documentation**
   - Ensure each component has proper JSDoc comments
   - Document props, state, and behavior
   - Document component responsibility
   - Document atomic design level where appropriate

3. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Create/update the main architecture documentation
   - Document the feature-first organization
   - Document the core layer foundation
   - Document component design principles
   - Document state management strategy

4. **Best Practices Documentation**
   - Document component size limitations
   - Document single responsibility principle
   - Document hierarchical composition
   - Document props management
   - Document state management patterns

5. **Migration Guides**
   - Create documentation for migrating from old patterns
   - Document how to convert existing code to new patterns
   - Provide examples of before and after

6. **Example Code**
   - Create example implementations for reference
   - Document common patterns and antipatterns
   - Provide templates for new components and features

## Documentation Examples

### Core Module README Example

```markdown
# Core API Module

The Core API module provides a standardized way to interact with backend services across the application.

## Usage

Import the necessary functions from the core API module:

```typescript
import { useQuery, useMutation } from '@/core/api';
```

## Features

- Standardized API client with error handling
- TanStack Query integration for data fetching and caching
- Type-safe request and response handling
- Automatic token management
- Request/response interceptors

## Components

### Hooks

- `useQuery` - Hook for data fetching with TanStack Query
- `useMutation` - Hook for data mutations with TanStack Query
- `useInfiniteQuery` - Hook for paginated data fetching
- `useUpload` - Hook for file uploads

### Services

- `apiClient` - Base Axios client with configuration
- `authInterceptor` - Authentication interceptor
- `errorInterceptor` - Error handling interceptor

## Examples

### Basic Query

```typescript
const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery(
  ['products'],
  '/api/products'
);
```

### Mutation with Optimistic Updates

```typescript
const { mutate, isLoading } = useMutation(
  '/api/products',
  {
    method: 'POST',
    onSuccess: (data) => {
      // Handle success
    },
    onError: (error) => {
      // Handle error
    }
  }
);

// Usage
mutate({ name: 'New Product', price: 9.99 });
```
```

### Component Documentation Example

```typescript
/**
 * Button component for user interactions.
 * 
 * This is an atomic component that serves as the primary button element across the application.
 * It supports various styles, sizes, and states to accommodate different design needs.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <Button
 *   variant="primary"
 *   size="md"
 *   onClick={handleClick}
 * >
 *   Click Me
 * </Button>
 * ```
 */
export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  variant = 'primary',
  size = 'md',
  isLoading = false,
  leftIcon,
  rightIcon,
  children,
  disabled,
  className = '',
  ...rest
}) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

### Architecture Documentation Example

```markdown
# Feature-First Architecture

Our application follows a feature-first architecture that organizes code around business capabilities rather than technical layers.

## Principles

### Feature-First Organization

- Structure code around discrete business capabilities rather than technical layers
- Each feature represents a complete vertical slice with its own UI, logic, and data access
- Features are independent, self-contained modules that should never directly depend on other features

### Core Layer Foundation

- Clearly separate cross-cutting concerns into dedicated core modules
- Core layers include: authentication, authorization (RBAC), data fetching utilities, shared state management
- Features consume core services through well-defined interfaces but never modify core directly

### Modular Component Design

- Never construct large monolithic components - break everything down into small, focused pieces
- Each component should have a single responsibility and be under 200 lines of code
- Design components to be independently testable, maintainable, and reusable within their feature
- Apply atomic design principles to component hierarchies

## Directory Structure

```
/src
  /core                     # Core cross-cutting concerns
    /auth                   # Authentication services
    /rbac                   # Role-based access control
    /api                    # API client setup
    /ui                     # Shared UI component library
    /utils                  # Common utilities
    
  /features                 # Feature modules
    /feature1               # Complete business capability
    /feature2
    ...
    
  /pages                    # Next.js pages
    /feature1               # URL routes for feature1
    /feature2               # URL routes for feature2
    _app.tsx               # Core providers wrapping the application
```
```

## Verification Criteria
- Documentation created/updated for all core modules
- Component documentation updated with JSDoc comments
- Architecture documentation accurately reflects new structure
- Best practices clearly documented
- Migration guides provided
- Example code for common patterns provided
- Documentation is clear, accurate, and helpful

## Time Estimate
Approximately 2-3 days

## Dependencies
- All previous refactoring tasks

## Risks
- Documentation may become outdated if not maintained
- New team members may not follow documented patterns if not properly onboarded
- Documentation may not cover all edge cases
