# Import Update Report for Exams Preparation Feature

## Summary

This report summarizes the current state of imports in the `exams-preparation` feature and provides a plan for updating imports in files outside the feature.

## Current State

- All internal imports within the `exams-preparation` feature have been properly configured
- Module-level index.ts files have been created for clean exports
- The feature-level index.ts properly exports all necessary components and utilities
- Import paths within moved files have been updated to use correct relative paths

## Import Patterns Used

The following import patterns are now used within the feature:

1. **Between modules within the feature:**
   ```typescript
   // Example: Importing utils in a component
   import { formatTime } from '../../utils';
   ```

2. **From feature-level exports:**
   ```typescript
   // Example: From another feature
   import { ExamContainer } from '@/features/exams-preparation';
   ```

3. **From core modules:**
   ```typescript
   // Example: Using core API module
   import { useQuery } from '@/core/api';
   ```

## Files Outside the Feature

Several files in the application still import from the old `exams` feature and will need to be updated:

- 3 app pages in the `(exams)` route group
- 1 app page in the `(dashboard)` route group
- 3 integration points in other features (payments, dashboard)

A detailed plan for updating these imports has been created in `import-update-plan.md`.

## Verification

All imports within the `exams-preparation` feature have been verified to work correctly:

- No circular dependencies found
- No references to the old `exams` feature within the new feature
- Proper use of index.ts files for clean exports
- Adherence to the feature-first organization principle

## Next Steps

1. Follow the plan in `import-update-plan.md` to update imports in files outside the feature
2. Create a compatibility layer in the `exams` feature if needed for a phased migration
3. Test all updates to ensure functionality is maintained
4. Eventually deprecate and remove the old `exams` feature
