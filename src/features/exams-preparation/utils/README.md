# Exams Preparation Utilities

This directory contains utility functions specific to the exams-preparation feature.

## Purpose

- Provide reusable pure functions for common operations
- Handle data transformations and calculations
- Support components and hooks with shared functionality

## Guidelines

1. Utilities should be pure functions (same input â†’ same output, no side effects)
2. Group related utilities in separate files
3. Document parameters and return values
4. Write unit tests for utilities
5. Leverage core utilities when possible

## Example Structure

```
utils/
  examScoring.ts          # Functions for calculating exam scores
  formatters.ts           # Functions for formatting exam-related data
  validators.ts           # Functions for validating exam-related data
  examAnalytics.ts        # Functions for analyzing exam performance
  index.ts                # Public exports
```

## Example Usage

```ts
// Example utility
export function calculateExamScore(
  answers: UserAnswer[],
  questions: ExamQuestion[]
): ExamScoreResult {
  const totalQuestions = questions.length;
  const attempted = answers.length;
  
  const correctAnswers = answers.filter(answer => {
    const question = questions.find(q => q.id === answer.questionId);
    return question && question.correctOptionId === answer.selectedOptionId;
  });
  
  const correct = correctAnswers.length;
  const incorrect = attempted - correct;
  const unattempted = totalQuestions - attempted;
  
  const scorePercentage = totalQuestions > 0 
    ? (correct / totalQuestions) * 100 
    : 0;
    
  return {
    totalQuestions,
    attempted,
    correct,
    incorrect,
    unattempted,
    scorePercentage: Math.round(scorePercentage * 10) / 10,
    passed: scorePercentage >= 70, // Pass threshold 70%
  };
}
```
