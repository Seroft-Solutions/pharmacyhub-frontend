# State Management Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing proper state management in the exams-preparation feature according to the "core as foundation" principle. It provides a step-by-step guide and code examples for each subtask.

## Implementation Overview

The state management implementation will follow these key principles:

1. **Core as Foundation**: Leverage core state utilities rather than reimplementing patterns
2. **Feature-Specific Extensions**: Extend core utilities with feature-specific needs
3. **Clean Public API**: Export state management through a well-organized index
4. **Consistent Patterns**: Follow established patterns for stores and contexts
5. **Proper Documentation**: Document all implementations and usage patterns

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Feature-Specific Store Factory Implementation

The feature-specific store factory extends the core store factory with feature-specific functionality.

**Location**: `src/features/exams-preparation/state/storeFactory.ts`

**Status**: Already implemented. The existing implementation properly:
- Uses the core `createStoreFactory`
- Adds feature-specific prefix
- Adds error handling and logging
- Provides proper TypeScript typing

**Next Steps**:
- Review existing code to ensure it's up to date
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Enhance documentation as needed

### 2. Feature-Specific Context Factory Implementation

The feature-specific context factory extends the core context factory with feature-specific functionality.

**Location**: `src/features/exams-preparation/state/contextFactory.ts`

**Status**: Already implemented. The existing implementation properly:
- Extends the core `createContextProvider`
- Adds feature-specific naming and error handling
- Implements a feature-specific HOC
- Provides proper TypeScript typing

**Next Steps**:
- Review existing code to ensure it's up to date
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Enhance documentation as needed

### 3. Implement Exam Store with Core Patterns

The exam store manages the state for exam execution including navigation, answers, and timing.

**Location**: `src/features/exams-preparation/state/stores/examStore.ts`

**Status**: Already implemented with proper core integration.

**Next Steps**:
- Review to ensure consistent patterns
- Add any missing functionality
- Enhance documentation as needed

### 4. Implement Exam Editor Store with Core Patterns

The exam editor store manages the state for creating and editing exams.

**Location**: `src/features/exams-preparation/state/stores/examEditorStore.ts`

**Status**: Implemented but may need review to ensure proper use of feature-specific factory.

**Steps to Update**:
1. Update import to use feature-specific factory: `import { createExamsStore } from '../storeFactory';`
2. Replace `createStore` with `createExamsStore`
3. Ensure proper error handling and persistence

**Example Update**:
```typescript
// Before
export const examEditorStore = createStore<...>(...)

// After
export const useExamEditorStore = createExamsStore<...>(...)
```

### 5. Implement Exam Filters Context with Core Patterns

The exam filters context manages filtering state for exam listings.

**Location**: `src/features/exams-preparation/state/contexts/ExamFilterContext.tsx`

**Status**: Implemented but uses core factory directly instead of feature-specific factory.

**Steps to Update**:
1. Update import to use feature-specific factory: `import { createExamsContext } from '../contextFactory';`
2. Replace `createContextProvider` with `createExamsContext`

**Example Update**:
```typescript
// Before
export const [ExamFilterProvider, useExamFilter] = createContextProvider<...>(...)

// After
export const [ExamFilterProvider, useExamFilter] = createExamsContext<...>(...)
```

### 6. Create Public API for State Management

The public API exports all state management utilities through a clean interface.

**Location**: `src/features/exams-preparation/state/index.ts`

**Status**: Already implemented with proper exports.

**Next Steps**:
- Review to ensure all exports are included
- Enhance documentation on exports
- Ensure proper organization of exports

### 7. Create State Management Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for the state management implementation.

**Location**: `src/features/exams-preparation/docs/STATE_MANAGEMENT.md`

**Status**: Needs implementation.

**Content**:
- Overall state management architecture
- Feature-specific factory usage
- Store implementation patterns
- Context implementation patterns
- Best practices and guidelines
- Examples of usage in components

## Implementation Timeline

| Subtask | Estimated Time | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| Review Feature-Specific Store Factory | 1 hour | Focus on documentation |
| Review Feature-Specific Context Factory | 1 hour | Focus on documentation |
| Review Exam Store | 2 hours | Ensure proper core integration |
| Update Exam Editor Store | 2 hours | Convert to feature-specific factory |
| Update Exam Filters Context | 1 hour | Convert to feature-specific factory |
| Review Public API | 1 hour | Ensure clean exports |
| Create Documentation | 2 hours | Comprehensive guide |

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **Core Integration**: All state management uses core utilities without reimplementation
2. **Feature-Specific Factories**: All stores and contexts use feature-specific factories
3. **Clean Public API**: All state management is exported through a clean index
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Documentation clearly explains implementation and usage
5. **Consistent Patterns**: All implementations follow the same patterns and principles
6. **Unit Tests**: Key utilities have proper unit tests

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for implementing proper state management in the exams-preparation feature. By following this plan, we can ensure that the feature properly leverages core utilities, maintains consistency, and provides a clean public API for other parts of the feature.
