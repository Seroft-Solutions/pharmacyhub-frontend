# Core Integration Verification Checklist

This document serves as a final verification checklist to ensure the exams-preparation feature properly integrates with all core modules. Use this checklist for quality assurance and future reference.

## API Integration

- [x] Uses `@/core/api/hooks/query/useApiQuery` for data fetching
- [x] Uses `@/core/api/hooks/mutation/useApiMutation` for data mutations
- [x] Properly defines query keys using core utilities
- [x] Handles errors using core error handling utilities
- [x] Avoids reimplementing API functionality available in core
- [x] Documented API integration in `CORE-INTEGRATION.md`

## Auth Integration

- [x] Uses `@/core/auth` hooks for authentication
- [x] Uses `AuthGuard` component from core auth module
- [x] Updated `ExamAccessGuard` to leverage core auth
- [x] Properly handles authentication loading and error states
- [x] Documented auth integration in `AUTH_INTEGRATION.md`

## RBAC Integration

- [x] Uses `@/core/rbac/hooks` for permission checks
- [x] Added `PermissionGuard` component that leverages core RBAC
- [x] Created `useExamPermissions` hook that uses core RBAC
- [x] Added permission registration with core RBAC registry
- [x] Updated `PremiumContentGuard` to use core RBAC
- [x] Documented RBAC integration in `RBAC_INTEGRATION.md`

## UI Component Integration

- [x] Uses shadcn components from `@/components/ui` correctly
- [x] Components follow atomic design principles
- [x] Components maintain proper size limits (<200 lines)
- [x] Components follow single responsibility principle
- [x] Documented UI integration in `UI_COMPONENT_INTEGRATION.md`

## Utilities Integration

- [x] Added exam-specific logger built on core logger
- [x] Uses core utilities for cross-cutting concerns
- [x] Added feature-specific utilities for exam functionality
- [x] Updated utility exports to include new utilities
- [x] Documented utilities integration in `UTILITIES_TESTING_INTEGRATION.md`

## Testing Integration

- [x] Added testing utilities built on core testing utilities
- [x] Created mock data generators for exams, questions, and attempts
- [x] Added utilities for rendering with providers
- [x] Documented testing integration in `UTILITIES_TESTING_INTEGRATION.md`

## Documentation

- [x] Created comprehensive documentation for each integration area
- [x] Added usage examples for core module integration
- [x] Documented best practices for each integration area
- [x] Created this verification checklist for final review

## Final Verification

- [x] No usage of old core paths (`@/features/core/*`)
- [x] No duplicate functionality available in core
- [x] Consistent integration approach across all core modules
- [x] Follows feature-first organization principle
- [x] Follows core as foundation principle
- [x] Maintains backward compatibility where necessary

## Performance Considerations

- [x] Minimized component re-renders through proper hook usage
- [x] Used appropriate data fetching strategies
- [x] Used efficient state management patterns
- [x] Avoided unnecessary computations and operations

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Consider migrating storeFactory to use core state management
- [ ] Enhance test coverage for core integration points
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for complex operations
- [ ] Continue refining documentation as the feature evolves
