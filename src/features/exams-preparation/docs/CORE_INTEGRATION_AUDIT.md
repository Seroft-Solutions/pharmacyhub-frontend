# Core Module Integration Audit

This document provides a comprehensive audit of the exams-preparation feature's integration with core modules, identifying areas that are already properly integrated and those that need attention.

## Integration Status Overview

| Module Area | Current Status | Recommendation |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| UI Components | ✅ Good | Already using `@/components/ui/*` properly |
| API Integration | ✅ Good | Already using `@/core/api/*` properly |
| State Management | ⚠️ Custom Implementation | Consider promoting to core or replacing |
| Logger | ❌ Issue | Fix imports from non-existent `@/core/utils/logger` |
| Auth & RBAC | ⚠️ Needs Verification | Verify integration with core auth/RBAC |

## Detailed Findings

### UI Components
The feature correctly uses UI components from `@/components/ui/*`. Examples:

```tsx
// Correct usage:
import { Card, CardContent, CardFooter } from '@/components/ui/card';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
```

### API Integration
The feature properly leverages core API module with appropriate hooks and patterns:

```tsx
// Correct usage:
import { useApiQuery } from '@/core/api/hooks/query/useApiQuery';
```

The API hooks are built on top of the core API client and follow the established patterns.

### State Management
The feature uses a custom implementation of store factory:

```tsx
// src/features/exams-preparation/state/storeFactory.ts
/**
 * Store factory to create Zustand stores with consistent patterns
 * 
 * Note: This is a candidate for promotion to core in the future.
 * As patterns prove useful, they can be moved to core for wider use.
 */
```

This is a good candidate for promotion to the core modules if the patterns are consistent with core architecture principles. Otherwise, it should be replaced with core state management utilities if they exist.

### Logger
The feature imports a logger from a path that appears to not exist:

```tsx
// Current import in examStore.ts:
import logger from '@/core/utils/logger';
```

However, the `@/core/utils/logger` path doesn't exist. The core API error logging is using:

```tsx
// In core/api/core/error/errorLogger.ts:
import { logger } from '@/shared/lib/logger';
```

But this path doesn't exist either. This needs to be resolved to ensure consistent logging throughout the application.

### Auth & RBAC
Core Auth and RBAC modules exist:
- `@/core/auth/*`
- `@/core/rbac/*`

However, the exams-preparation feature's integration with these modules needs verification.

## Recommended Actions

1. **Logger Integration**
   - Identify the correct logger implementation to use
   - Update all logger imports in the exams-preparation feature
   - Ensure consistent logging practices

2. **State Management**
   - Evaluate whether to promote the custom storeFactory to core
   - Document the decision and rationale
   - Either promote to core or replace with existing core solution

3. **Auth & RBAC**
   - Verify how the feature handles authentication and permissions
   - Ensure proper integration with core auth and RBAC modules
   - Fix any inconsistencies

4. **Documentation**
   - Create documentation explaining core integration patterns
   - Add examples of proper usage
   - Document any feature-specific extensions
