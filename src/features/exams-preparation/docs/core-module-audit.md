# Core Module Usage Audit for Exams Preparation Feature

## Summary

This audit evaluates the integration of the Exams Preparation feature with the Core Module Foundation. The goal is to ensure the feature properly leverages core services and follows the Core Layer Foundation principle without duplicating functionality available in core.

## Current State

After a thorough analysis of the Exams Preparation feature, we've found the following:

### Core Modules Currently Used

| Core Module | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| **API** | ✅ Integrated | Using `@/core/api/hooks/query/useApiQuery` and related hooks for data fetching |
| **Auth** | ⚠️ Not verified | No direct imports found, but feature likely uses auth services |
| **RBAC** | ⚠️ Not verified | Feature exports RBAC-related functionality, but integration with core RBAC not confirmed |
| **UI** | ✅ Partially integrated | Using `@/components/ui/badge` for Badge component, but not fully verified for all components |
| **State** | ❌ Not integrated | Using deprecated store factory instead of core state management |
| **Utils** | ✅ Integrated | Using `@/core/utils/logger` for logging |

### Positive Findings

1. The feature is structured according to Feature-First Organization principles with proper separation of concerns
2. API integration appears to leverage the core API module correctly
3. Utils module correctly uses core utilities like the logger
4. The feature exports a clean public API through index.ts files
5. Component organization follows atomic design principles

### Areas for Improvement

1. **State Management Integration**: The feature uses a deprecated store factory that explicitly states it should be migrated to use `@/core/state`:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * DEPRECATED: This store factory has been promoted to core.
    * 
    * Use the core state module instead:
    * import { createStore, createStoreFactory, createSelectors } from '@/core/state';
    * 
    * See docs/STATE_MANAGEMENT.md for migration details.
    */
   ```

2. **Auth and RBAC Integration**: While the feature has RBAC-related exports, integration with core auth and RBAC modules needs to be verified and potentially updated.

3. **UI Component Integration**: Need to ensure all UI components properly leverage the core UI component library rather than implementing custom patterns.

## Comparison with Expected Imports

### Current Imports
- `@/core/api/hooks/query/useApiQuery` - ✅ Correct 
- `@/core/utils/logger` - ✅ Correct
- `@/components/ui/badge` - ⚠️ Should ideally be from `@/core/ui/atoms`

### Missing or Deprecated Imports
- `createStore` from local `storeFactory.ts` should be from `@/core/state`

## Recommendations

Based on this audit, the following updates are recommended:

1. **State Management Migration**: 
   - Migrate the store factory to use `@/core/state` module
   - Update all stores to use the core state management pattern

2. **Auth & RBAC Verification**:
   - Verify and update integration with core auth services
   - Ensure proper usage of core RBAC module

3. **UI Component Alignment**:
   - Ensure UI components use the core UI library

## Next Steps

1. Document the specific files that need updates for each core module
2. Prioritize the state management migration as it's explicitly marked as deprecated
3. Create a detailed plan for updating each area of improvement

## Conclusion

The Exams Preparation feature generally follows the Core as Foundation principle but requires specific updates to fully align with the architecture guidelines. The most critical update is the state management migration, followed by verification and updates to Auth, RBAC, and UI component integration.
