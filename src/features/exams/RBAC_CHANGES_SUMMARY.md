# RBAC Migration Changes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to migrate the Exams feature to the new centralized RBAC system.

## Changes Made

1. **Moved old permission system to deprecated folders:**
   - `hooks/useExamPermissions.ts` → `hooks/deprecated/useExamPermissions.ts`
   - `constants/permissions/index.ts` → `constants/deprecated/permissions/index.ts`

2. **Added deprecation notices to old files:**
   - Added deprecation warnings in the old files with migration instructions
   - Made the old hooks re-export from deprecated locations for backward compatibility

3. **Updated ExamSidebarMenu.tsx:**
   - Replaced `usePermissions` with `useFeatureAccess` and `useExamFeatureAccess`
   - Updated permission checks to use the new operation-based system

4. **Added Migration Documentation:**
   - Created `RBAC_MIGRATION.md` with comprehensive migration guide

## Existing Implementations

Several components were already using the new RBAC system:

1. **ExamsList.tsx:**
   - Already using `ExamOperationGuard` and `useExamFeatureAccess`

2. **ExamDashboard.tsx:**
   - Already using `ExamGuard`, `ExamOperationGuard`, and other guards

3. **ui/guards/ExamGuard.tsx:**
   - Already implemented with the new RBAC system

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Verify Functionality:**
   - Test all components to ensure they work with the new RBAC system

2. **Future Clean-Up:**
   - Eventually remove deprecated folders when all code has been migrated

## Migration Benefits

1. **Centralized Access Control:**
   - Single source of truth for RBAC rules
   - Better management of feature permissions

2. **More Granular Control:**
   - Operation-level permissions for fine-grained access control

3. **Simplified API:**
   - More intuitive hooks and components
   - Better type safety with enums
