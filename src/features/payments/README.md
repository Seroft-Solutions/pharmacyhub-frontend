# Payments Feature - Network Request Loop Fix

## Problem
The network tab was showing multiple repeated requests to payment-related endpoints, causing performance issues. This happened because:

1. React Query hooks were being used directly in components without proper caching
2. Multiple components were making the same API calls
3. Missing state management for payment-related data

## Solution
We've implemented a comprehensive Zustand-based solution to fix these issues:

1. Created a centralized Zustand store for payment data
2. Implemented optimized hooks with proper caching
3. Created a context provider for premium exam information
4. Modified components to use the optimized state management

## Key Components

### 1. Zustand Store
The `manualPaymentStore.ts` provides a centralized cache and state management with:
- Time-based caching with a 1-minute TTL by default
- Persistent storage using `zustand/persist`
- Deduplication of identical API requests
- Proper loading and error states

### 2. Custom Hooks
Custom hooks in `useManualPayment.ts` provide simple interfaces for components:
- `useManualExamAccess` - Check if a user has access to a premium exam
- `useManualPendingRequest` - Check if a user has a pending payment request
- `useUserManualPaymentRequests` - Get all user payment requests
- `usePremiumExamInfo` - Combined premium exam info (access + pending status)

### 3. Context Provider
The `PremiumExamInfoProvider` component:
- Creates a React context for premium exam information
- Wraps exam components to provide premium info to all children
- Prevents redundant API calls in nested components

### 4. API Compatibility Layer
The `hooks.ts` file:
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- Re-exports the new hooks with the same names as the old ones

## Benefits

- **Reduced Network Requests**: Caching prevents duplicate API calls
- **Better Performance**: Less network traffic and fewer re-renders
- **Simplified Components**: Cleaner component code without direct API calls
- **Consistent State**: Single source of truth for payment data
- **Offline Support**: Persisted data for better offline experience

## Technical Details

- Cache TTL set to 60 seconds (configurable in the store)
- Uses localStorage for persistence via Zustand
- Selectors for optimal component rendering
- Context provider to share state between components

## Implementation Notes

All changes are implemented by directly updating existing files, maintaining compatibility with the current codebase. The most notable changes are:

1. ExamContainer.tsx now uses a PremiumExamInfoProvider
2. ExamStartScreen.tsx now gets premium info from context 
3. Direct TanStack Query calls are replaced with cached Zustand store calls
