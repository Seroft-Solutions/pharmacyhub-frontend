# Final Build Errors Fix Summary

This document summarizes the final fixes implemented to resolve the build errors in the PharmacyHub frontend project.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Export in RBAC Feature

- **Problem**: The `featureFlagService` was being exported twice from the `rbac/index.ts` file, once from the API export and once directly from the services folder.
- **Solution**: Removed the duplicate export, keeping only the one from the API export.

### 2. Missing Permissions Constants

- **Problem**: The `RoleGuards.tsx` component was importing from a non-existent `constants/permissions` module.
- **Solution**: Created the permissions constants file with comprehensive role and permission definitions to support the RBAC system.

### 3. Client Component Using Server-Only Hooks

- **Problem**: The `ReviewMode.tsx` component was using the client-side `useRouter` hook without the `"use client"` directive.
- **Solution**: Added the required directive to ensure proper client-side rendering.

### 4. Missing Types for Exam Models

- **Problem**: The exams feature was missing proper type definitions for `MCQPaper` and `UserAnswer` that were being referenced.
- **Solution**: Created a comprehensive types file with all required interfaces for the exams feature.

## Architecture Improvements

All fixes were implemented following these principles:

1. **Feature-Based Approach**: Each fix was contained within its respective feature module, maintaining the established architecture.

2. **Complete Type Definitions**: Added comprehensive type definitions rather than minimal fixes to ensure better type safety throughout the application.

3. **Consistent Patterns**: Maintained the existing patterns for constants, components, and type definitions.

4. **Client/Server Separation**: Properly marked client components to ensure Next.js server components work correctly.

## Next Steps

Now that all build errors are resolved, we recommend:

1. Adding unit tests for the components and features to catch type errors early
2. Implementing a component documentation system
3. Setting up CI/CD processes to check for build errors automatically
4. Creating a style guide to maintain consistency across features
