# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## What is an ADR?
An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Template

### Title
```markdown
# ADR [number]: [title]

## Status
[Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded]

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

## Alternatives Considered
What other approaches did we consider and why weren't they chosen?

## Sample ADRs

### ADR 1: Next.js App Router Migration
```markdown
# ADR 1: Next.js App Router Migration

## Status
Accepted

## Context
- Current Pages Router becoming deprecated
- Need for better server-side rendering
- Improved performance requirements
- Better support for React Server Components

## Decision
Migrate to Next.js App Router architecture:
- Use server components by default
- Implement client components where needed
- Adopt new data fetching patterns
- Use new routing conventions

## Consequences
### Positive
- Better performance
- Improved SEO
- Reduced client-side JavaScript
- Future-proof architecture

### Negative
- Learning curve for team
- Migration effort required
- Some libraries need updates
- Initial setup complexity

## Alternatives Considered
1. Stay with Pages Router
   - Simpler but becoming obsolete
2. Different meta-framework
   - Less ecosystem support
3. Custom solution
   - Too much maintenance

### ADR 2: State Management Strategy
```markdown
# ADR 2: State Management Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
- Need for efficient state management
- Multiple state types (server, client, UI)
- Performance considerations
- Team expertise

## Decision
Implement hybrid state management:
- Zustand for global UI state
- React Query for server state
- Context for local component state
- localStorage for persistence

## Consequences
### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns
- Optimized for different state types
- Reduced boilerplate
- Better performance

### Negative
- Multiple patterns to learn
- Integration complexity
- Initial setup overhead

## Alternatives Considered
1. Redux
   - Too much boilerplate
   - Overkill for our needs
2. MobX
   - Less TypeScript support
3. Jotai/Recoil
   - Less mature ecosystem

## Important Areas for ADRs

### 1. Architecture Decisions
- Framework choices
- State management
- Routing strategy
- Data fetching
- Authentication

### 2. Technical Stack
- Build tools
- Testing frameworks
- CI/CD tools
- Monitoring solutions
- Deployment strategy

### 3. Development Practices
- Code organization
- Testing strategy
- Documentation approach
- Release process
- Performance optimization

### 4. Security Decisions

- Major architectural changes
- Technology stack changes
- Security-related decisions
- Performance optimizations
- Process changes

### 2. Review Process
- Team discussion
- Technical review
- Impact assessment
- Implementation plan
- Documentation update

### 3. Organization
- Chronological order
- Category-based
- Status tracking
- Version control
- Cross-referencing
