# PharmacyHub - Fixed Build Errors

## Summary

Successfully fixed the remaining TypeScript build errors by implementing the following solutions:

### 1. Fixed Import Paths in Dashboard Pages

Updated imports in dashboard pages to use the feature-based structure:
- Updated `usePermissions` and `useAccess` imports to point to `@/features/rbac/hooks`
- Updated `useSession` imports to point to `@/features/auth/hooks`
- Updated `useAuth` imports to point to `@/features/auth/hooks`
- Updated component imports to use the correct feature modules

### 2. Created Missing Components for Email Verification

Added the missing `EmailVerificationView` component:
- Created the verification directory structure in the auth feature
- Implemented a comprehensive email verification component
- Connected it properly to the auth service
- Updated exports in the feature to include the verification components

### 3. Fixed Query Provider Import

Updated the QueryProvider import to use the tanstack-query-api feature:
- Changed from shared library to feature-specific implementation
- Ensured exam features continue to work correctly

### 4. Feature Exports Enhancement

Updated feature exports for better maintainability:
- Added exports to make components available at the feature level
- Maintained the proper organization within features

## Benefits

1. **Improved Feature Organization**: All functionality is now correctly organized within its respective feature
2. **Reduced Maintenance Overhead**: No bridging components or compatibility layers needed
3. **Type Safety**: All components now have proper TypeScript typing
4. **Build Success**: Resolved all webpack build errors

The application now follows a consistent feature-based architecture, making it more maintainable and easier to extend in the future.
