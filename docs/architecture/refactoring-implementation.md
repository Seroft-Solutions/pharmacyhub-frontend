# Architecture Principles Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the architecture principles defined in PHAR-291.

## Component Size Limitations

We've implemented a strategy to enforce component size limitations:

1. **Analysis Script**
   - Created a component size analyzer in `scripts/size-analyzer`
   - Script identifies components exceeding the 200-line limit and functions exceeding the 30-line limit
   - Generates reports in the `reports` directory

2. **Refactoring Approach**
   - Implemented a modular approach to break down large components
   - Applied multiple decomposition strategies based on component type
   - Maintained backward compatibility during refactoring

## Implementation Example: Auth Module

We've refactored the auth module in the core directory as an example implementation:

### Before Refactoring

- `tokenManager.ts` (372 lines) - Handled multiple token-related responsibilities
- `authStore.ts` (337 lines) - Mixed state management, actions, and RBAC helpers

### After Refactoring

1. **Token Management**
   - Split into a modular structure in `core/auth/core/token/`:
     - `token-constants.ts` - Configuration and constants
     - `token-storage.ts` - Token storage operations
     - `token-device.ts` - Device ID management
     - `token-validation.ts` - Token validation and parsing
     - `token-initialization.ts` - Initialization from API responses
     - `index.ts` - Unified interface for backward compatibility

2. **Auth Store**
   - Split into a modular structure in `core/auth/state/store/`:
     - `auth-store-types.ts` - Type definitions
     - `auth-store-init.ts` - Initialization utilities
     - `auth-store-actions.ts` - Auth actions (login, logout)
     - `auth-store-rbac.ts` - RBAC helper functions
     - `auth-store-selectors.ts` - Selector hooks for state access
     - `auth-store-init-hook.ts` - Initialization hook
     - `index.ts` - Unified exports

## Applied Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle

- Each module now has a single, clear responsibility
- Functions and components are focused on specific tasks
- Clear naming indicates purpose of each component

### Container/Presentation Pattern

- Separated data management from presentation concerns
- Created clear interfaces between modules
- Extracted business logic into dedicated modules
- Provided hooks and selectors for clean access to functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Refactoring**
   - Apply these principles to other oversized components
   - Prioritize components based on the refactoring-priorities.json report

2. **Enforce in Development Process**
   - Add linting rules to enforce size limits
   - Create PR templates that check for component size
   - Document patterns and approaches for team reference

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Update tests to match new component boundaries
   - Add tests for individual modules
   - Ensure backward compatibility is maintained
