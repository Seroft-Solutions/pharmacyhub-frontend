# PharmacyHub Exams Feature Cleanup

This document outlines the changes made to organize the exam feature properly under the features directory structure and cleanup redundant files.

## Updated Directory Structure

All exam-related code is now organized under the `src/features/exams` directory with the following structure:

```
src/features/exams/
├── api/
│   ├── examApi.ts
│   ├── examPaperService.ts
│   └── examService.ts
├── model/
│   ├── mcqTypes.ts
│   └── types.ts
├── hooks/
│   ├── useExamQueries.ts
│   └── useExams.ts
├── store/
│   ├── examPaperStore.ts
│   ├── examSlice.ts
│   ├── examStore.ts
│   └── mcqExamStore.ts
└── ui/
    ├── components/
    │   ├── ExamTimer.tsx
    │   ├── PerformanceCharts.tsx
    │   ├── QuestionCard.tsx
    │   ├── QuestionNavigation.tsx
    │   └── ResultsView.tsx
    ├── mcq/
    │   ├── McqExamLayout.tsx
    │   ├── McqExamList.tsx
    │   └── McqExamResults.tsx
    ├── quiz/
    │   ├── ExamLayout.tsx
    │   ├── ExamSettings.tsx
    │   └── ExamTimer.tsx
    ├── results/
    │   ├── PerformanceCharts.tsx
    │   └── ResultsView.tsx
    ├── ExamContainer.tsx
    ├── ExamLanding.tsx
    ├── ExamList.tsx
    └── ExamPaperCard.tsx
```

## Files Updated to Use Feature-Specific Stores

We've updated the following files to use the feature-specific stores instead of the legacy store:

1. `src/components/exam/ExamLayout.tsx`
2. `src/components/exam/QuestionNavigation.tsx`
3. `src/components/exam/ExamTimer.tsx`
4. `src/features/exams/hooks/useExamQueries.ts`
5. `src/features/exams/ui/ExamContainer.tsx`

## Files Safe to Remove

The following files are now redundant and can be safely removed:

1. `src/store/examStore.ts` - Replaced by `src/features/exams/store/mcqExamStore.ts`

## Component Migration

The exam UI components have been properly organized in the feature folder structure, with components being moved to appropriate subfolders:

- Basic exam components are under `ui/components/`
- MCQ-specific components are under `ui/mcq/`
- Quiz-specific components are under `ui/quiz/`
- Results visualization components are under `ui/results/`

## Store Implementation Notes

We now have three different implementations of exam stores in the feature folder:

1. `examStore.ts` - A simple implementation for basic exam state
2. `mcqExamStore.ts` - A comprehensive implementation for MCQ exam interactions
3. `examPaperStore.ts` - A specialized store for exam papers

We've standardized on using `mcqExamStore.ts` as the primary store for exam interactions.

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider consolidating the exam stores into a single, unified store with proper typing
2. Ensure all components use the feature-specific API client and hooks
3. Remove any other legacy exam-related code outside the feature directory
4. Update documentation to reflect the new organization

By following this cleanup, we now have a consistent, well-organized feature structure that follows the project's architectural patterns.
