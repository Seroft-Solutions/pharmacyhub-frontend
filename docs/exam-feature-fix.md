# PharmacyHub Exam Feature Fix

## Issue
The exam feature was not working correctly, displaying "Failed to load exams. Please try again later." error. This was primarily due to API communication issues between the frontend and backend.

## Solution
The issue has been fixed by properly configuring the API communication in the frontend. Key changes include:

### 1. Corrected API URL Configuration

Updated the `examService.ts` file to correctly use the environment variable for the API base URL with a fallback:

```typescript
// Using environment variable for API base URL with fallback
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:8080';
const API_URL = `${API_BASE_URL}/api/exams`;
```

### 2. Improved Request Headers

Added proper headers to prevent caching issues:

```typescript
headers: {
  'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
  'Pragma': 'no-cache'
}
```

### 3. Added Credentials Support

Ensured requests include credentials for authentication:

```typescript
credentials: 'include'
```

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling

Improved error messages, logging, and the user experience when errors occur, making it easier to debug issues.

## How to Verify

1. Make sure the backend server is running (typically at http://localhost:8080)
2. Ensure there are published exams in the database 
3. Start the frontend application
4. Navigate to the Exams page

If you still encounter issues, the enhanced error page provides troubleshooting guidance.
