# Exam Feature Fix Documentation

## Issue Overview

The exams feature had TypeScript errors related to the `ExamStatus` export from `mcqTypes.ts`. The adapter file was trying to use `ExamStatus` as an enum with properties like `ExamStatus.DRAFT`, but it was defined as a TypeScript type: `type ExamStatus = 'DRAFT' | 'PUBLISHED' | 'ARCHIVED'`. 

Additionally, there were missing type definitions for `ExamQuestion` and `ExamOption` that were referenced in the adapter file.

## Changes Made

1. Updated `mcqTypes.ts` to provide both a type and const object for ExamStatus:
   ```typescript
   // The type for type checking
   export type ExamStatusType = 'DRAFT' | 'PUBLISHED' | 'ARCHIVED';
   
   // The constant for consistent enum-like usage
   export const ExamStatus = {
     DRAFT: 'DRAFT',
     PUBLISHED: 'PUBLISHED',
     ARCHIVED: 'ARCHIVED'
   } as const;
   ```

2. Added missing type definitions for `ExamQuestion` and `ExamOption`:
   ```typescript
   export interface ExamQuestion {
     id: number;
     text: string;
     options: ExamOption[];
     explanation: string;
     points: number;
   }
   
   export interface ExamOption {
     id: string;
     text: string;
     isCorrect: boolean;
   }
   ```

3. Updated the `Exam` interface to use the new `ExamStatusType`.

4. Updated `adapter.ts` to:
   - Import the new `ExamStatusType`
   - Fix the return type of `mapBackendStatus`
   - Fix property names in the `adaptBackendExam` function to match the `Exam` interface

## Architecture Notes

The exam feature follows a clean architecture pattern with:

1. **Model layer** - Type definitions in `mcqTypes.ts` and `types.ts`
2. **API layer** - API clients and adapters to transform data between frontend and backend formats
3. **UI layer** - React components to render the exam interface
4. **Store layer** - State management for exam data

The adapter pattern is used to transform data between different formats, making it easy to handle changes in API responses without affecting the rest of the application.

## Future Improvements

1. Consider consolidating types between `mcqTypes.ts` and `types.ts` to avoid duplication
2. Add runtime type validation using a library like Zod
3. Add unit tests for the adapter functions to ensure they correctly transform data

## Additional Information

The exam feature is integrated with the backend through REST APIs defined in the `examApi.ts` file. The backend provides endpoints for:
- Retrieving exam lists and details
- Starting an exam attempt
- Submitting answers
- Retrieving results

The frontend handles exam presentation, timer management, and result display.
