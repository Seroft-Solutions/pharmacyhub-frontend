# Enhanced Exam Feature - Technical Documentation

## Overview

The exam feature has been completely redesigned and enhanced to provide a robust, user-friendly system for conducting and tracking online exams. The implementation follows modern React patterns with a focus on:

- Component-based architecture
- Clean separation of concerns
- Type-safe development
- API integration via TanStack Query
- Robust state management with Zustand
- Responsive and accessible UI

## Architecture

### 1. Data Flow

```
User Interaction → UI Components → Zustand Store ↔ TanStack Query Hooks ↔ API Endpoints
```

### 2. Directory Structure

## Key Components

### 1. API Integration

- **examService.ts**: Defines all API endpoints for interacting with the backend
- **useExamApi.ts**: Custom hooks for data fetching and mutations, built on TanStack Query
- **queryKeys.ts**: Defines query keys for cache management

### 2. UI Components

- **ExamContainer**: Main orchestration component for exam flow
- **QuestionDisplay**: Renders a single exam question with options
- **QuestionNavigation**: Allows navigation between questions
- **ExamProgress**: Shows progress through the exam
- **ExamTimer**: Displays and manages remaining time
- **ExamSummary**: Shows overview of all questions and statuses
- **ExamResults**: Displays detailed exam results with analytics

### 3. Hooks and State Management

- **useExamSession**: Comprehensive hook for managing the entire exam session
- **examStore.ts**: Zustand store for client-side state management with persistence

## Feature Capabilities

The enhanced exam feature provides the following capabilities:

1. **Exam List**
   - View all published exams
   - Filter by status, difficulty, etc.
   - Search by title or description

2. **Exam Taking**
   - Start a new exam attempt
   - Navigate between questions
   - Flag questions for review
   - Track time remaining
   - Automatically submit when time expires
   - Review all answers before submission

3. **Results and Analytics**
   - View detailed exam results
   - See correct and incorrect answers
   - Get explanations for each question
   - Analyze performance metrics

## Implementation Details

### 1. State Management

The exam feature uses a dual-layer state management approach:

- **Zustand Store**: Manages client-side state such as current question, answers, flags, etc.
  - Persists state to localStorage to handle page refreshes
  - Syncs with API for data consistency

- **TanStack Query**: Manages server state like exam data, attempts, and results
  - Handles caching, refetching, and mutations
  - Provides loading and error states

### 2. API Integration

All API integration is done through TanStack Query hooks:

```typescript
// Example usage:
const { data: exam, isLoading } = useExam(examId);
const { mutate: submitExam } = useSubmitExamMutation(examId);
```

### 3. UX Considerations

- **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality works without JavaScript
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **Offline Support**: State persistence allows for resuming exams
- **Accessibility**: All components are built with accessibility in mind

## Testing

The feature includes sample data for testing without a backend:

- **sampleExamData.ts**: Provides mock exam data, questions, and attempts

## Future Enhancements

1. **Offline Mode**: Complete offline support with sync when online
2. **Different Question Types**: Support for multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, etc.
3. **Media Support**: Add images, videos, and other media to questions
4. **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed performance metrics and insights
