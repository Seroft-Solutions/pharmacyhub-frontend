# PharmacyHub Exams Feature - Problem Diagnosis

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: Next.js application with React components organized by features
- **Backend**: Spring Boot application with REST API endpoints
- **Data Flow**: Client -> API Services -> Redux/Zustand Stores -> UI Components

### Exam Feature Components
1. **Frontend**:
   - `McqExamList` component for displaying available exams
   - Exam service for API communication (`examService.ts`)
   - Data adapter for converting backend models to frontend types
   - Multiple stores for state management (examSlice.ts, examStore.ts)

2. **Backend**:
   - RESTful API controllers (`ExamController`, `ExamPaperController`, `ExamAttemptController`)
   - Service layer for business logic
   - Repository layer for data access
   - Entity models and DTOs for data representation
   - Sample data loader for initializing exam content

## Identified Issues

### 1. API Communication Failure
- The frontend is making a request to `/api/exams/published` endpoint
- When loading the Exams page, this API call fails, resulting in the error message: "Failed to load exams. Please try again later."
- The browser's network tab shows 404 status code responses for exam-related API calls

### 2. Data Model Mismatch
- Potential inconsistency between frontend expected data model and backend response structure
- The adapter (`adapter.ts`) defines mappings for `BackendExam` to `Exam`, but these may not match the actual API response

### 3. Backend Data Loading
- The `ExamDataLoader` is configured to load exams from JSON files, but only a single sample file exists
- Exams are loaded as DRAFT status by default, but frontend is requesting PUBLISHED exams

### 4. API Proxy Configuration
- Next.js needs proper API routing configuration to proxy requests to the backend
- There appears to be no middleware or API route configuration for handling `/api/exams` paths

### 5. Error Handling
- The frontend has error handling in the component, but the user experience is poor when API calls fail
- No fallback content is provided when exams can't be loaded

## Root Causes

1. **Missing API Proxy Configuration**: The Next.js application needs to be properly configured to route API requests to the Spring Boot backend.

2. **Unpublished Exams**: The sample exam data is loaded in DRAFT status, but the frontend is requesting PUBLISHED exams.

3. **Development Environment Setup**: Potential misconfiguration in the development environment preventing proper communication between frontend and backend.

4. **API Path Inconsistency**: The frontend might be using incorrect API paths that don't match the backend's defined endpoints.

## Potential Bottlenecks

1. **Data Adapter Complexity**: The multiple layers of type conversion between backend and frontend models could introduce bugs.

2. **Multiple State Stores**: The feature uses multiple state stores (Redux slice and Zustand store), which could lead to state management issues.

## Impact Assessment

The exams feature is completely non-functional, preventing users from:
- Viewing available exams
- Starting new exam attempts
- Completing practice exams

This significantly impacts the core functionality of the PharmacyHub application for exam preparation.
