## Naming Conventions

### Files

1. **README Files**
   - Each directory should contain a `README.md` file providing an overview of that section
   - README files should follow a consistent structure with a clear table of contents

2. **Document Names**
   - Use kebab-case for all markdown files: `file-name-example.md`
   - Be descriptive but concise (3-5 words maximum)
   - Avoid abbreviations unless they are project standards

3. **Image Files**
   - Follow pattern: `[section]-[description]-[size].[extension]`
   - Example: `auth-login-flow-diagram-800x600.webp`

### Directories

1. **Section Directories**
   - Always maintain the numbered prefix: `01-overview`, `02-architecture`, etc.
   - Never create new top-level directories without team review

2. **Subdirectories**
   - Use kebab-case: `code-examples`, `api-documentation`
   - Group related content logically

## Formatting Standards

### Markdown Guidelines

1. **Headers**
   - Use ATX-style headers with a space after the hash: `## Heading`
   - Follow proper hierarchy (don't skip levels)
   - Main document title is H1, sections are H2, subsections are H3, etc.

2. **Lists**
   - Use hyphens (`-`) for unordered lists
   - Use numbers (`1.`) for ordered lists
   - Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)

3. **Code Blocks**
   - Always specify the language for syntax highlighting
   - Use triple backticks (```) for code blocks
   - Use single backticks (`) for inline code

4. **Tables**
   - Use proper table formatting with alignment indicators
   - Include headers for all tables
   - Keep tables simple and readable

5. **Links**
   - Use relative paths for internal documentation links
   - Use descriptive link text (avoid "click here")
   - Check links periodically to ensure they work

### Images and Diagrams

1. **Diagrams**
   - Use SVG format when possible
   - Include alt text for accessibility
   - Keep file sizes reasonable (<200KB)
   - Maintain consistent styling (colors, shapes, fonts)

2. **Screenshots**
   - Use WebP format
   - Crop to focus on relevant content
   - Annotate when necessary
   - Include dark mode versions when applicable

## Documentation Workflow

### Creating New Documentation

1. **Planning**
   - Determine the appropriate section
   - Review existing documentation to avoid duplication
   - Create an outline before writing

2. **Writing**
   - Follow the formatting standards
   - Include relevant code examples
   - Provide diagrams for complex concepts
   - Keep content concise but comprehensive

3. **Review**
   - Submit for peer review
   - Ensure technical accuracy
   - Check for clarity and readability
   - Verify all links work

4. **Publishing**
   - Place in appropriate numbered directory
   - Update relevant README files with links
   - Announce significant documentation updates

### Updating Existing Documentation

1. **Identify Updates Needed**
   - Verify content is outdated or incomplete
   - Check if related documents need updating

2. **Make Changes**
   - Update factual information
   - Improve examples
   - Refresh screenshots
   - Enhance clarity

3. **Review and Publish**
   - Have changes reviewed
   - Add update date at the bottom of the document
   - Update any cross-references

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style

1. **Tone**
   - Professional but approachable
   - Direct and clear
   - Active voice preferred
   - Consistent voice throughout

2. **Audience Awareness**
   - Write for the intended audience (developers, designers, etc.)
   - Explain technical terms when first introduced
   - Provide context for complex concepts

3. **Structure**
   - Start with a brief overview/purpose statement
   - Use logical progression of concepts
   - Include a table of contents for lengthy documents
   - Summarize key points at the end of complex sections

### Content Types

   - Expected outcomes
   - Troubleshooting tips

3. **Reference Documentation**
   - Comprehensive details
   - Organized for quick lookup
   - Complete parameter/option lists
   - Version information when relevant

4. **Tutorial Documentation**
   - Learning-focused

   - Expand existing sections based on feedback

### Documentation Ownership

1. **Section Owners**
   - Each numbered section has a primary owner responsible for accuracy
   - Section owners review changes to their section
   - Section owners identify improvement opportunities

2. **Cross-Functional Review**

   - Usability reviews for clarity and structure
   - New developer reviews for comprehensibility

## Best Practices

1. **Include Real Examples**
