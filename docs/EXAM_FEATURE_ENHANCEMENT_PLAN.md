# Exam Feature Enhancement Plan

## Current State Analysis

The current exam feature implements basic functionality for:
- Viewing available exams
- Starting an exam session
- Answering questions
- Submitting exams

The backend architecture is comprehensive with proper entities for:
- Exams
- Exam Papers
- Exam Attempts
- Exam Results
- Flagged Questions

## Enhancement Objectives

1. **Break Down Monolithic Components**:
   - Split `ExamContainer` into smaller, reusable components
   - Create separate components for question display, navigation, and submission

2. **Implement Missing UI Features**:
   - Question flagging functionality
   - Exam timer with auto-submit
   - Answer review mode
   - Pagination for question navigation
   - Detailed results visualization

3. **Improve State Management**:
   - Enhance React Query integration
   - Extend Zustand store for better local state handling

4. **Add User Experience Improvements**:
   - Progress tracking
   - Question status indicators (answered, flagged, unanswered)
   - Confirmation dialogs for important actions
   - Accessibility improvements

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Small, Focused Components

1. **QuestionDisplay**: Renders a single exam question with options
2. **QuestionNavigation**: Provides navigation between questions
3. **ExamProgress**: Shows progress through the exam
4. **ExamTimer**: Displays and manages remaining time
5. **FlagQuestion**: Allows users to flag questions for review
6. **ExamSummary**: Shows overview of all questions and their status
7. **ExamResults**: Displays detailed exam results with analytics

### 2. Enhance API Integration

1. Extend `examApi.ts` to support all backend endpoints
2. Update React Query hooks to provide comprehensive data access
3. Implement optimistic updates for better user experience

### 3. Improve State Management

1. Extend the Zustand store to track:
   - Flagged questions
   - Time spent per question
   - Navigation history
   - Exam completion status

### 4. Implement Advanced Features

1. **Question Flagging**:
   - Add UI for flagging questions for later review
   - Create a review mode to revisit flagged questions

2. **Timer Functionality**:
   - Add countdown timer with visual indicators
   - Implement auto-save and auto-submit functionality

3. **Review Mode**:
   - Create a review screen showing all questions and answers
   - Allow users to navigate directly to specific questions

4. **Results Visualization**:
   - Add charts and visualizations for exam performance
   - Show detailed feedback on answers

## Technical Approach

1. Use atomic design principles to create a hierarchy of components
2. Ensure all components are properly typed with TypeScript
3. Follow established project patterns for API integration
4. Implement proper error handling and loading states
5. Ensure accessibility compliance

## Testing Strategy

1. Create unit tests for individual components
2. Implement integration tests for component interactions
3. Test API integration with mock data
4. Perform end-to-end testing of the complete exam flow

## Timeline

1. **Phase 1**: Create base components and enhance API integration
2. **Phase 2**: Implement timer and question flagging functionality
3. **Phase 3**: Add review mode and results visualization
4. **Phase 4**: Final integration, testing, and refinement
