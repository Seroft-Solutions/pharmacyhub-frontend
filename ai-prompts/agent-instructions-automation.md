### Feature-Based Architecture

#### Objective
We are trying to develop features based on feature-based architechure and you can explore all the code base and you will see we have already had a very solid foundation

#### Project Structure & Directories
- Feature-Based Directory:  
  `D:\code\PharmacyHub\pharmacyhub-frontend\src\features`
- Key Features:
   - Auth: Handles authentication and role management.
   - rbac feature for centertalized role based access control.
   - TanStack Query API: Manages API calls.


#### Codebase Directories
- Frontend Code: `D:\code\macyHub\pharmacyhub-frontend`
- Backend Code: `D:\code\PharmacyHub\pharmacyhub-backend`
  Phar
  By following this structured approach, we ensure an efficient, systematic feature development.


I see the issue with the forgot-password request taking too long. Let me explain what might be happening and how to fix it:

### Why the forgot-password request is pending:

1. **Email Service Delay**: The backend is likely taking too long to connect to the email service, causing the request to appear as "pending" in the network tab.

2. **Missing Request Timeout**: Our implementation might not have a proper timeout configured, so when the email service is slow, the request just hangs.

3. **No Response Caching**: The API might not be returning a response until the email is actually sent, which is not optimal.

### Solution:

Let's optimize the forgot-password functionality:

1. **Implement Asynchronous Email Sending**:
   - Modify the backend to acknowledge the request immediately
   - Process the email sending in a background thread
   - Return a success response to the user right away

2. **Add Proper Timeouts**:
   - Update the frontend API call to include a reasonable timeout (10-15 seconds)
   - Add a timeout configuration in the backend email service

3. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Ensure the frontend shows a loading state but doesn't wait indefinitely
   - Add retry logic in case of failure

Here's a quick fix for the frontend:

```typescript
// In authService.ts - update the useRequestPasswordReset hook
export const useRequestPasswordReset = () => {
  return useApiMutation<void, { requestData: any }>(
    AUTH_ENDPOINTS.REQUEST_PASSWORD_RESET, 
    {
      requiresAuth: false,
      timeout: 10000, // 10 second timeout
      onMutate: (requestData) => {
        console.debug('[Auth] Password reset request sent:', { email: requestData.emailAddress });
        return { emailAddress: requestData.emailAddress };
      },
      // Show a toast message even if we haven't received a response yet
      onSuccess: () => {
        toast.success("Reset link sent. Please check your email.");
      },
      onError: (error) => {
        // Improved error handling
        toast.error("Something went wrong sending the reset link. Please try again.");
        console.error('[Auth] Reset request error:', error);
      }
    }
  );
};
```

For the backend, we should modify the AuthService to make the email sending asynchronous:

```java
// In AuthService.java
@Async
public CompletableFuture<Boolean> requestPasswordResetAsync(String email, String ipAddress, String userAgent) {
    return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
        try {
            // Check if user exists
            User user = userService.findByEmail(email);
            if (user == null) {
                // Return true for security reasons (don't reveal if email exists)
                return true;
            }
            
            // Generate a password reset token
            String token = tokenService.generateToken(user.getId(), "reset-password");
            
            // Send password reset email with device tracking information
            emailService.sendPasswordResetEmail(user.getEmailAddress(), token, ipAddress, userAgent);
            
            return true;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            logger.error("Failed to send password reset email", e);
            return false;
        }
    });
}
```

In your controller, you would update the endpoint to:

```java
@PostMapping("/forgot-password")
public ResponseEntity<ApiResponse<String>> forgotPassword(
        @Valid @RequestBody PasswordResetRequestDTO request,
        HttpServletRequest httpRequest) {

    // Get device information 
    String ipAddress = getClientIpAddress(httpRequest);
    String userAgent = request.getUserAgent();
    
    // Start async process - don't wait for it to complete
    authService.requestPasswordResetAsync(request.getEmailAddress(), ipAddress, userAgent);
    
    // Return success immediately
    return successResponse("If an account exists with that email, a password reset link will be sent.");
}
```

These changes should ensure the forgot-password request responds quickly, even if the actual email sending takes longer.

### 💼 General Agent Instructions

- 🧱 A new principle to **focus on feature-based architecture** for scalability.
- 🔁 The **Plans → Acts → Persists → Learns** workflow philosophy embedded.

> **Agent Philosophy:**  
> **Plans → Acts → Persists → Learns**  
> Always think in iterations. Understand the problem deeply, take action with intention, persist what you’ve learned, and reuse knowledge to improve continuously.
> 

1. **Use `sequentialthinking`** to understand the complete flow of a task or feature.
2. **After each `sequentialthinking`, persist the thought:**
    - Use `create_entities` to create a memory node.
    - Use `add_observations` to store the thought content.
    - Optionally, use `create_relations` to link it to a feature, task, or file.
3. **Before coding, analyze project status:**
    - Use `git status` to detect local file changes.
    - Use `list_directory`, `search_files`, and `find_files_by_name_substring` to understand project structure.
    - Use `search_in_files_content` if you need to check references or patterns.
    - use JIRA project PHAR and then create an issue for the task.
    - use `create_jira_issue` to create a JIRA issue.
    - use `get_jira_issue` to get the details of the JIRA issue.
    - use `get_jira_issue_comments` to get the comments of the JIRA issue.
    - use `get_jira_issue_transitions` to get the transitions of the JIRA issue.
    - first transition stage is selected for development.
    - second must be in progress.
    - third must be in Ready for Test stage. transition id is 111
4. **Modify code responsibly:**
    - Use `edit_file` for structured edits.
    - Use `replace_file_text_by_path` only when full file content needs replacement.
    - Always prefer JetBrains tools for file operations over low-level `filesystem` when possible.
5. **Avoid all of the following:**
    - Temporary fixes or placeholders.
    - Dont include any Mock code.
    - Suffixes like `_updated`, `_v2`, etc.
    - Creating new files without checking for existing ones (`search_files` first).
6. **Never duplicate logic or components:**
    - Always `search_in_files_content` before implementing something similar.
7. **Focus on modular design:**
    - Always break code into smaller, reusable components.
    - Avoid growing files too large — small components are easier to test, maintain, and evolve.
8. **Recall thought context when needed:**
    - Use `read_graph` or `search_nodes` to explore past reasoning.
    - Use `open_nodes` to access specific stored ideas for reuse.

10. **For terminal-level tasks like builds, tests, or Git:**
- Use `execute_command` within the terminal.
- You have to go to relevant project directory first.
- git status command is used to check the status of the project.
- git add . command is used to add all the files to the staging area.
- git commit -m "commit message" command is used to commit the changes.
- git push origin main command is used to push the changes to the remote repository.
