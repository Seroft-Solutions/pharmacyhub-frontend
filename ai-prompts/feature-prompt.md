### Feature-Based Architecture

#### Objective
We are trying to develop features based on feature based architechure and you can explore all the code base and you will see we have already had a very solid foundation

#### Project Structure & Directories
- Feature-Based Directory:  
  `D:\code\PharmacyHub\pharmacyhub-frontend\src\features`
- Key Features:
    - Auth: Handles authentication and role management.
    - rbac feature for centertalized role based access control.
    - TanStack Query API: Manages API calls.


#### Requirement Summary
- We are working on the Exam feature
- Please explore all the exam feature codebase and understand the flow.
- We have to complete this flow.
- You can use the `sequential_thinking` tool to understand the flow.
- We have to complete the usecases, like question submissions review answers etc.
- You have to make sure frontend api calls are working fine and apis are available on the pharmacyhub-backend code.
- For any api call, you have to use the `TanStack Query API` feature.


### Coding instructions
- Use `sequential_thinking` to understand the complete flow.
- Utilize JetBrains tools for code refactoring.
- Check VCS status to understand the current development changes
- You can use brave_search to understand the the nextjs and shadcn components.
- Avoid rewriting code manually; instead, use:
    - `move_file` to move files.
    - `edit_file` to modify existing files.
    - `search in files` to locate references.
    - `replace in files` to update code.
- Ensure you can use all mcp tools, like filesystem, sequential_thinking, etc
- Dont use any suffix or prefix like enhanced, update etc. Always fix the original file, and before writing any new file, please do search and see if it already there or not.
- Ensure, you never need to write any temp fix, any mock thing

#### Codebase Directories
- Frontend Code: `D:\code\PharmacyHub\pharmacyhub-frontend`
- Backend Code: `D:\code\PharmacyHub\pharmacyhub-backend`

By following this structured approach, we ensure an efficient, systematic feature development.
